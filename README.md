# File encryption and decryption

In today's digital age, safeguarding sensitive information is of utmost importance due to the proliferation of digital data exchange. Information security, particularly encryption, is crucial, with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) being a highly regarded method for data protection. This project delves into AES encryption, explaining its key principles, from key generation to encryption and decryption processes. It aims to empower individuals and organizations with the knowledge and practical skills to enhance their information security. By mastering AES encryption, readers can secure their data assets against evolving digital threats, bridging the gap between theory and real-world application for robust data protection.

In the provided code, the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm plays a crucial role in ensuring the security of files. AES is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm, and it offers several important security concepts and mechanisms, which are used in the code as follows:
* Confidentiality
* Symmetric Encryption
* Block Cipher
* Padding
* Mode of Operation (ECB)

## Project Working

For working of this project we have used various libraries in python. With use of Flask web application we enabled the users to upload and manipulate files (text, PDF, and DOCX) by either encrypting or decrypting them using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. 
Letâ€™s see some of the key components of backend working:
1) Flask setup
2) Key generation
3) Encryption and Decryption Functions
4) Routes for different file formats
5) Uploading and Processing
6) Download Route
